flattened
=========

Solarized, without the bullshit, unlike the original.

And not much consistency, just like the original.

Until I get around to unify all the colors used by all the Solarized versions, the different versions of flattened will be just as messed as Solarized itself.

On the left, solarized; on the right, flattened_dark.

## 16 COLORS

This looks pretty much like the official screenshots because the terminal emulator is set to use the Solarized palette instead of the default 16 colors palette.

Beyond that terminal emulator setup, there's nothing special to do in Vim.

## 256 COLORS

256 colors is a bit trickier. Since none of the colors used in Solarized can be found in the standard xterm palette the author decided to "degrade" his color palette to something that's *very* far from the official screenshots or, really, from every Solarized user's expectations. So, yeah, the "256color" version of flattened_dark doesn't look like the "16color" version or the GUI version.

## GUI

Yes, in its GUI incarnation, Solarized uses a palette that's slightly different from the "standard" one so you get yet another slightly different look and feel. How cool and smart and scientific!
